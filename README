This is protection for 10" screws installed on Turnigy Talon Quadcopter (V2.0) Carbon Fiber Frame 550mm
(http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=22781).
Files starting with "protection" are protective frame itself. It's made from 3mm Foam PVC (2 layers) and 50mm Foam PS (1 layer).
Files starting with "protection-mod" are special thing to center protection on Talon V2.0 frame 
(it's with error - outer rectangle should be rotated for 45 degree).

It would be good to combine both parts.
Python files are scripts to run within FreeCAD 0.13 (or later) is you want to see it in 3D or change.
